# Intro

I am a Full stack web developer coming from the world of Product management and Marketing. I've been working in this field for the past 6 years and was drown to the world of programming and web design as I was working with several other dev teams and thought 'I can do that'. I've taken some time to learn the whole basics of Javascript and the top libraries as well as Liquid (Shopify) as that is where I originally discovered my passion and ability to code.

# Some history

- After graduating from hi-school I decided to take a leap of faith and try solo-traveling i booked a one way ticked to the US and traveled coast to coast, met some amazing people (Talking to you Chris) and when to some places that made me feel at home-far-from-home

- at 25, while finishing my BA (communications and International relations) I decided to continue my studying in Vienna Europe, I got a room with a family friend and moved, to what would be 5 of my most interesting years, I learn German from the very basics to a B2.2 level (Wenn Sie Deutsch gelernt haben, wissen Sie, was für eine große Herausforderung das ist.) and started at the university of Vienna

- As I finally discovered international relations is just not my cup of tea, I changed course, moved back to Israel, and started my career in marketing and product management. Fun time that made my much more confident in my abilities, during my first office position, I moved from uploading products to an appliances site to managing the whole site including running ads and handling all the active development in less than a year

# I dream of

- Amazing projects of both tech and hobbie in nature.
- Cool Crochet art that has a clear guide I can give a go to.
- Traveling and meeting new people
- Staying curious.
- Continually improving.
